The COLaF program (Corpus and Tools for the Languages of France) aims to strengthen automatic text and speech processing for the languages and speakers of France.

This will be achieved through the creation of open datasets, which we will then use to develop models and open-source tools.

COLaF is led by [Inria](https://www.inria.fr/fr), and more specifically the [ALMAnaCH](https://almanach.inria.fr/index-en.html) and [MULTISPEECH](https://team.inria.fr/multispeech/) teams, specialised respectively in text and speech.

COLaF's three main objectives are:

- Making artificial intelligence (AI) accessible to the diversity of French speakers by providing tools adapted to social and geographical variation.
- Breaking down barriers between French speakers by taking into account specialised languages, immigrant languages and French sign language.
- Protecting and promoting France's linguistic richness by developing tools for regional languages and its overseas languages.
