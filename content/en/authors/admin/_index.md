Through the COLaF project (Corpus et Outils pour les Langues de France, Corpus and Tools for the Languages of France), [Inria](https://www.inria.fr/en) aims to contribute to the development of free corpora and tools for French and other languages of France, in close collaboration with academic and institutional [partners](#partners).


The scope of COLaF includes both:
- **Text data** ([ALMAnaCH](https://almanach.inria.fr/index-en.html) Inria Paris Centre),
- **Speech and sign language data** ([MULTISPEECH](https://team.inria.fr/multispeech/), Inria Centre at the University of Lorraine).


COLaF aims to cover French and the languages of France in all its diversity:
- It aims to have a coverage as diverse as possible: French from France and elsewhere, regional languages, French-based creoles (including outside France), indigenous languages, migrant languages, French sign language.
- All aspects of variation will be studied, beyond the standard state of the language, including specialised languages, diachrony, non-standard states (user-generated content, learner language, etc.).


Activity within the project notably covers the acquisition and structuring of texts from non-textual sources (books, audio recordings, etc.), the classification by language and linguistic variety of large volumes of texts (in close connection with the [OSCAR](https://oscar-project.org/) project), the development of annotation and transformation models (translation, normalisation, voice synthesis, sign language generation) serving the development of corpora and the exploitation of newly created resources.


COLaF is an Inria [DEFI](https://www.inria.fr/en/inria-challenges-tackling-major-issues) led by [Beno√Æt Sagot](http://pauillac.inria.fr/~sagot/) (head of the ALMAnaCH project team) and [Slim Ouni](https://members.loria.fr/SOuni/) (member of the MULTISPEECH project team).
