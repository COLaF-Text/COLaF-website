The COLaF program (Corpus and Tools for the Languages of France) aims to strengthen the ecosystem of automatic text and speech processing for the languages and speakers of France.

To achieve this, it seeks to create open datasets and use them to develop models and open-source tools.

COLaF is led by [Inria](https://www.inria.fr/fr), particularly the [ALMAnaCH](https://almanach.inria.fr/index-en.html) and [MULTISPEECH](https://team.inria.fr/multispeech/) teams, whose expertise lies in text and speech, respectively.

The three major objectives of COLaF are as follows:

- Make artificial intelligence (AI) accessible to the diversity of French speakers by providing tools adapted to social and geographical variations.
- Break down silos among French speakers by considering specialized languages, immigrant languages, and French sign language.
- Protect and enhance the linguistic richness of the territory by developing tools for regional languages and overseas languages.
